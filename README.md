## Technical Implementations

Weather Companion is built using React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The following technical implementations were used to create the application:

React Hooks for managing the state and side effects of the components.
Axios for making API calls to retrieve weather data.
Moment.js for formatting and manipulating dates and times.
Styled Components for styling the components and creating a consistent look and feel.
React.js allowed us to create a responsive and dynamic user interface that updates in real-time with the latest weather information. The application is fast, efficient, and easy to use, making it the perfect weather companion for anyone looking to stay on top of the weather.
